Who are our power couples? These guys are in the tail of the distribution.

```{r}

  filter(mentions > 10) |> 
  select(show, couple, mentions)

Who are our top 3 oldies and top three new shows?

```{r}

Who are our super romantic shows?

Who's a last season kisser?

Now, to read in the ratings data.
```{r}
ratings <- read_sheet(ss = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R8WJhW0E-5_SnKRsT66lw4UuY45dezcGFVhQgJG2LIA/edit?usp=sharing",

ratings <- clean_names(ratings)

# Exclude ratings rows with missing data
ratings <- ratings[complete.cases(ratings), ]
```

Now, to join the two.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
# Left-join episodes and ratings into the couples
ratings_couples <- couples[1:20, ] |> 
  left_join(ratings, 
            by = join_by(show == show),
            relationship = "many-to-many")

# Create an indicator variable for episodes that aired after first kiss
ratings_couples <- ratings_couples |> 
  group_by(show, couple) |> 
  mutate(show_couple_id = 1:n(), 
         is_first_kiss_ep = season == first_kiss_season & episode == first_kiss_episode,
         first_kiss_id = min(ifelse(test = is_first_kiss_ep, yes = show_couple_id, no = 9999)),
         after_first_kiss = show_couple_id > first_kiss_id) |> 
  select(-is_first_kiss_ep, -first_kiss_id)
```

```{r}
#convention: turn true if at or past kiss episode
past_kiss <- function(curr_ep, curr_szn, kiss_ep, kiss_szn){
  pass <- FALSE
  if(curr_szn >= kiss_szn) {
    if(curr_ep >= kiss_ep) { pass <- TRUE}
  }
  pass
}

full <- left_join(ratings, couples, by = "show") #ISSUE
full <- full |>
  mutate(past <- past_kiss(episode, season, first_kiss_episode, first_kiss_season))
         
```
